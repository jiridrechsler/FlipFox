# 🦊 FlipFox 

**FlipFox** is a playful flashcard game for learning English.  
It uses two deck types:

- 🔢 **Number → Word** (e.g., days of the week, months)
- 🎨 **Image → Word** (e.g., colors, food, transportation)

You choose the **category** and **direction** (prompt → answer or reverse), set the **auto-reveal speed**, the **round length (number of cards)**, and start learning.  
FlipFox tracks your ✅ correct / ❌ incorrect answers, supports **pause**, and shows **results** at the end.  
A friendly **fox mascot 🦊** keeps the vibe fun for all ages.
